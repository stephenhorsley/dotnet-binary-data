# dotnet-binary-data

A .NET project to read (and write) fixed and variable length records from flat files containing
structured binary data.

It is an attempt to port some Java/Kotlin libraries which I wrote to migrate legacy data
stored as sequential and indexed sequential files on OpenVMS/RMS into a database.

The main objective of this project is to learn about .NET, C# and the development process.
