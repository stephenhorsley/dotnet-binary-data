# dotnet-binary-data

A .NET project to read (and write) fixed and variable length records from flat files containing
structured binary data.

I had previously written some Java/Kotlin libraries to migrate legacy data
stored as sequential and indexed sequential files on OpenVMS/RMS into a database.
This project is an attempt to provide similar behaviour with a .NET library.

However, my main objective is to learn more about .NET, C# and the development process.
